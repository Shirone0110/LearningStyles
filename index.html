                Nobody was born with knowledge. You have to learn everything, from how to use a spoon to quantum physics. Because learning is a life-long process, how you learn plays an important role in how far you can get. Learning styles varies, now we are going to see 2 different learning styles and then see what they have in common!

                Derek Muller believes that <q>when we teach, we must take into account what the learners know, including their incorrect knowledge.</q> His teaching involves learner in the conversation and ask for their knowledge on a problem before telling them the right answer. This is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a>.
                <br />
                This approach has been proved to be effective in his PhD:

                    <p>Two multimedia treatments were developed to teach the topic of quantum tunneling. One consisted of a lecture-style explanation with only correct information presented. The other took the form of a dialogue between a tutor and student, involving several of the common alternative conceptions. Students who saw the Dialogue performed significantly better on the post-test than those who saw the Exposition.</p>

            <h2>So what do these two methods have in common?</h2>
            <p>In my opinion, there are two things in common, the first one depends on other people, and the second one depends on the learner.</p>
            <p>
                Both of these method needs someone to guide the learner into the correct way of learning. In Derek Muller's approach, it needs teachers to put students into conversation so that they can find out new information eventually. Because only telling them the truth will not make them remember it. In Carol Dweck's approach, it involves parents' praising through the first 5 years of a child to shape the growth mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                And a very important thing is that both of these method require the learner to be open-minded. So that when they learn new things, like water is made from 2 Hydrogen and 1 Oxygen or tree take in carbon dioxide, they'll take that information in, not being a conservative person. That way, they can face their mistakes and learn from it, not run away and hide from it.

            <h2>More learning techniques: Gamification</h2>

            <p>
            Gamification, or learning through games is one of the teaching method that has already been explored. This method has not been apply widely, and still being underestimated by many educators because they think games are not good. But through competing and achieving goals, learning become so much fun and make students enjoy studying. By using games, students learn without even realizing. Not even students, gamification can also be applied in the workplace. I hope there will be a day when gamification is used rationally.
